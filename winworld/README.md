All you need is here. Running on `winworld.teaser.insomnihack.ch:1337`

This task is running on Windows Server 2016 Base (AWS medium instance), not inside a Nanoserver. You don't really need the exact same environment, most of the libraries (provided) should match an up-to-date Windows 10, therefore a Windows 10 host or VM is good enough.

Since I was too lazy to implement it properly in AppJailLauncher, you will need to run the following commands to setup this challenge correctly:
```bash
AppJailLauncher.exe /key:westworld.txt winworld.exe
AppJailLauncher.exe /key:flag.txt /port:1337 /timeout:12000000 winworld.exe
```

This will ensure that both `westworld.txt` and `flag.txt` can be read by the AppContainer ID generated by AppJailLauncher.

**HINT**: There is no (intended) vuln in the MarkovChain.
